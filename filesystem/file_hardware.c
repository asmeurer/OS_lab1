/* This is the simulation of the hardware.  Normally this would happen in the
 * device itself.  The data structures used here are "stored" on the device
 * itself, so we simulate that by calling malloc() and free().  We assume that
 * the data structures returned by these functions (i.e., memory pointers)
 * would be equivalent to the data structures returned by an actual
 * device.

 * The way it works is the filesystem manager calls these functions whenever it
 * creates or deletes a file or block.  Then this gives it the new memory for
 * that file or block, which is "one the device".  The filesystem manager
 * then writes to these data structures normally, which is the equivalent of
 * "writing to the device". */
